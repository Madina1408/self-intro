Hello,
My name is Madina Karimjonova. I am 29 years old.
I am junior frontend developer. I am originally from Uzbekistan
and currently live in Hamburg,
Germany with my husband and son.

I have bachalor's degree in Economics with Finance from Westminster International University in Tashkent. After graduation from university in July 2017, I worked in banking sector for 2 years.

Later I got married and moved to Europe with my husband. As I was searching for employment opportunities in  Europe in Finance field, I started learning how to code on Microsoft applications such as Excel VBA and PowerBI. Then I grew more interested in coding of what/if formulas, managing streams, lists and writing new functions in these applications. I found programming to be more appealing to me than finance. So I decided to switch careers.

My primary learning experience of programming comes from Projects in RS School. We did a number of projects during the courses and I had exposure to some programming languages. For example in a project about Online Zoo, we learnt more advanced elements  of HTML, CSS and JavaScript compared to the elements we learnt in project about Travel Website. In the project related to  Online Book Shop, one of my favorite projects, we only used Javascript for the complete project. I learnt DOM manipulation through this project, which I can confidently apply to new projects from now on. Also, I created the design for the website from the scratch, and developed a game-plan for myself on how to organize similar tasks. Throuch Async-Race project I learnt how to send requests to backend, JS animation and working with APIs.Most importantly, while doing this task I felt like working on a real project because we used webpack and eslint configurations. One of our last projects was to migrate JS project to Typescript. After completing the task, I can confidently say that I mastered Typescript. The last project which was to write LODASH methods into functions and to write unit tests for them was a bit challenging and at the same time interesting for as we had to implement functions without using array and object methods.

Moreover, I have also worked on side projects which was on React and Tailwind CSS. It was a little bit different experience from js projects because React provides state-of-the-art functionality and easy to use and highly productive js framework. Also, I had a little bit of experience on Python when working with data analysis in my previous work.

About my soft skills. I am deligent and determined and also of course detail-oriented.
